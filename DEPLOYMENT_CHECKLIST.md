# üöÄ Deployment Checklist - Performance Optimized Website

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. **Build & Test**
- [ ] Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to create production build
- [ ] Run `npm run perf:test` to analyze bundle size
- [ ] Run `npm run preview` to test production build locally

### 2. **Performance Verification**
- [ ] Bundle size is under 1.5MB total
- [ ] Largest JavaScript chunk is under 500KB
- [ ] Images are optimized and lazy-loaded
- [ ] Critical resources are preloaded

### 3. **Code Quality**
- [ ] No TypeScript errors (`npm run build` passes)
- [ ] All components use optimized versions where applicable
- [ ] Console logs are removed in production build
- [ ] Unused code is eliminated

### 4. **Performance Features Enabled**
- [ ] Lazy loading for routes (React.lazy)
- [ ] Image optimization (OptimizedImage component)
- [ ] Animation optimization (OptimizedMotion component)
- [ ] AOS optimization (useOptimizedAOS hook)
- [ ] Web Vitals monitoring
- [ ] Performance monitoring

## üåê Vercel Deployment

### 1. **Vercel Configuration**
- [ ] `vercel.json` is properly configured
- [ ] Caching headers are set for static assets
- [ ] Rewrites are configured for SPA routing
- [ ] Security headers are enabled

### 2. **Environment Variables**
- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production` in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Configure any API keys or environment-specific variables

### 3. **Domain & SSL**
- [ ] Custom domain configured (if applicable)
- [ ] SSL certificate is active
- [ ] HTTPS redirects are enabled

## üìä Post-Deployment Testing

### 1. **Performance Testing**
- [ ] Run Lighthouse audit (aim for 90+ performance score)
- [ ] Test on slow 3G network simulation
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Verify Core Web Vitals in production

### 2. **Functionality Testing**
- [ ] All pages load correctly
- [ ] Navigation works properly
- [ ] Images load with lazy loading
- [ ] Animations are smooth
- [ ] Contact forms work (if applicable)

### 3. **Cross-Browser Testing**
- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Edge (latest)
- [ ] Mobile browsers

## üéØ Performance Targets

### Core Web Vitals
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: < 1.5s ‚úÖ
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: < 2.5s ‚úÖ
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: < 100ms ‚úÖ
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: < 0.1 ‚úÖ

### Additional Metrics
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: < 3.5s
- **Speed Index**: < 3.0s
- **Total Blocking Time**: < 200ms

## üîç Monitoring & Maintenance

### 1. **Performance Monitoring**
- [ ] Web Vitals are being tracked
- [ ] Performance metrics are logged
- [ ] Set up alerts for performance degradation

### 2. **Regular Maintenance**
- [ ] Monitor bundle size growth
- [ ] Update dependencies regularly
- [ ] Review and optimize new features
- [ ] Monitor Core Web Vitals trends

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Large Bundle Size**
- Check `npm run perf:test` output
- Review manual chunks in `vite.config.ts`
- Consider lazy loading more components

**Slow Loading Images**
- Ensure OptimizedImage is used everywhere
- Check image file sizes and formats
- Consider WebP conversion

**Poor Animation Performance**
- Use OptimizedMotion component
- Reduce concurrent animations
- Check for layout thrashing

**High CLS Score**
- Reserve space for dynamic content
- Avoid inserting content above existing content
- Use CSS aspect-ratio for images

## üìã Final Verification Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build

# Analyze performance
npm run perf:test

# Test production build
npm run preview

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

## üéâ Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:
- ‚úÖ Lighthouse Performance Score: 90+
- ‚úÖ Bundle size under 1.5MB
- ‚úÖ FCP under 1.5s
- ‚úÖ LCP under 2.5s
- ‚úÖ All pages load correctly
- ‚úÖ No console errors
- ‚úÖ Mobile performance is good
